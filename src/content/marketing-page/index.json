To access the video meeting rooms, links are embedded into the team's name as it appears in the schedule. The PTGbot\\[2] is an open source tool that PTG track moderators use to surface what's currently happening at the event.Track moderators will send messages to the bot via the #openinfra-events channel on IRC, and from that information, the bot publishes a webpage\\[1] with several sections of information about what is happening \"now\" or \"next\". \n\n### IRC\n\nThe main form of synchronous communication between attendees during the PTG is on IRC. If you are not on IRC, learn how to get started here \\[3]. The main PTG IRC channel is #openinfra-events on the OFTC network. It's also used to interact with the PTGbot, and where OpenInfra Foundation staff will be present to help answer questions.\n\n### NEED HELP?\n\nIf you run into any issues during the PTG week, please Kendall Nelson (diablo_rojo) on IRC in the #openinfra-events channel or email ptg@openinfra.dev and we will help you out!\n\n### CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nThe PTG is for everyone. We have zero tolerance for harassment and other violations of the OpenInfra Community Code of Conduct. Before the PTG begins, please review the Code of Conduct\\[4] and know how to report an issue.\n\n\\[1] PTGbot: <https://ptg.opendev.org/ptg.html>\n\n\\[2] PTGbot Docs: <https://opendev.org/openstack/ptgbot/src/branch/master/README.rst>\n\n\\[3] IRC Setup: <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/irc.html>\n\n\\[4] Code of Conduct: <https://openinfra.dev/legal/code-of-conduct>"
